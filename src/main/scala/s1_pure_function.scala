/** Pure Function
 *
 * A function, f, with input type A and output type B (as a single type: A => B, pronounced "A to B" or "A arrow B")
 * is a computation which relates every value a of type A to exactly
 * one value b of type B such that b is determined solely by the value of a.
 * Any changing state of an internal or external process is irrelevant to computing the result f(a).
 * In other words, a function has no observable effect on the execution of the
 * program other than to compute a result given its inputs; we say that it has no side-effects.
 *
 * There are lots of pure functions which you are already familiar with.
 * Consider the addition (+) function on integers. It takes two integer values and returns an integer value.
 * For any two given integer values it will always return the same integer value.
 *
 * This all means for an expression to be referentially transparentâ€”in any program,
 * the expression can be replaced by its result without changing the meaning of the program.
